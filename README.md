# NumberGuesser

A Windows console application which selects a random number between 1-10 and then asks you to guess it. 

I followed the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFJjpMFJvI&t=1840s) to build this application in order to become more familar with C# and .NET.

This solution is not very neat and followed neither the principles of TDD or SRP. To improve upon this program tests would need to be written and the code further refacored.
